## üì• Installation Guide

### **Step 1: Install Required Dependencies**

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Install .NET 8.0 LTS**

Ensure you have the **.NET 8.0 SDK** installed.  ***LONG TERM SUPPORT***
üëâ [Download .NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)  
Verify the installation by running:
```sh
dotnet --version
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Project Dependencies
Run the setup script:
```
setup_dependencies.bat  # (Windows 11)
```
- Or manually install the required packages:

```
dotnet add package Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime --version 1.20.1
dotnet add package Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.Gpu --version 1.20.1
dotnet add package TorchSharp --version 0.101.0
dotnet add package MathNet.Numerics --version 5.0.0
dotnet add package Emgu.CV --version 4.6.0.5131
dotnet add package ManagedCuda --version 10.0.0
dotnet add package System.IO.Ports --version 7.0.0
dotnet add package InputSimulatorStandard --version 1.0.0
dotnet add package RJCP.SerialPortStream --version 3.0.1
dotnet add package SharpDX --version 4.2.0
dotnet add package SharpDX.Direct3D11 --version 4.2.0
dotnet add package SharpDX.DXGI --version 4.2.0
dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json --version 13.0.3
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Execution Policy for PowerShell
Open PowerShell as Administrator, navigate to the directory containing `install.ps1`, and run:
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
.\install.ps1
```
- click Y to continue if is asked you if you want to proceed.

### make sure to `CD` the `src` folder before doing below: 
## üîß Build and Run the Project
1Ô∏è‚É£ Restore Dependencies
```
dotnet restore
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Compile the Project
```
dotnet build
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Launch the Assistive Aim Guide
```
dotnet run
```
- Upon launch, a UI will prompt you to select a YOLO model before the tracking system starts.

### üéÆ How It Works
1. Select the YOLO model using the UI at launch.
2. Select your game window (or use the primary monitor for capture).
3. The AI detects objects in real-time and calculates the required movement.
4. The mouse moves naturally toward detected objects (no snap-locks).
5. FPS & latency are monitored in real-time and displayed in the console.
6. Exit the tool at any time by pressing the configured key.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
You can edit the config.json file to tweak settings such as:

- Model file (`model_path`)
- Sensitivity (`mouse_speed`)
- Reaction delay (`reaction_time`)
- Detection confidence (`detection_threshold`)
- Enabled features (`visuals`, `debug_mode`)

```
{
  "model_path": "yolov8m.onnx",
  "mouse_speed": 1.5,
  "reaction_time": 50,
  "detection_threshold": 0.4,
  "visuals": true,
  "debug_mode": false,
  "gpu_id": 0
}
```

## üîß Troubleshooting
- Issue: Tool not detecting objects?
- Fix: Ensure your screen capture or camera is working and properly positioned.
---
- Issue: Mouse movements feel robotic.
- Fix: Adjust mouse_speed and reaction_time in config.json.
---
- Issue: Performance is slow.
- Fix: Verify you have an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support and check the FPS monitor.
---
- Issue: Arduino Leonardo not recognized.
- Fix: Ensure the correct COM port is set and the drivers are properly installed.

# üöÄ NVIDIA CUDA Installation Guide

### 1. **Download the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit 11.8**

First, download the CUDA Toolkit 11.8 from the official NVIDIA website:

üëâ [Nvidia CUDA Toolkit 11.8 - DOWNLOAD HERE](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive)

### 2. **Install the CUDA Toolkit**

- After downloading, open the installer (`.exe`) and follow the instructions provided by the installer.
- Make sure to select the following components during installation:
  - CUDA Toolkit
  - CUDA Samples
  - CUDA Documentation (optional)

### 3. **Verify the Installation**

- After the installation completes, open the `cmd.exe` terminal and run the following command to ensure that CUDA has been installed correctly:
  ```
  nvcc --version
  ```
This will display the installed CUDA version.

### **4. Install Cupy**
Run the following command in your terminal to install Cupy:
  ```
  pip install cupy-cuda11x
  ```

## 5. CUDNN Installation üß©
Download cuDNN (CUDA Deep Neural Network library) from the NVIDIA website:

üëâ [Download CUDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/downloads/compute/cudnn/secure/8.9.6/local_installers/11.x/cudnn-windows-x86_64-8.9.6.50_cuda11-archive.zip/). (Requires an NVIDIA account ‚Äì it's free).

## 6. Unzip and Relocate üìÅ‚û°Ô∏è
Open the `.zip` cuDNN file and move all the folders/files to the location where the CUDA Toolkit is installed on your machine, typically:

```
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8
```


## 7. Get TensorRT 8.6 GA üîΩ
Download [TensorRT 8.6 GA](https://developer.nvidia.com/downloads/compute/machine-learning/tensorrt/secure/8.6.1/zip/TensorRT-8.6.1.6.Windows10.x86_64.cuda-11.8.zip).

## 8. Unzip and Relocate üìÅ‚û°Ô∏è
Open the `.zip` TensorRT file and move all the folders/files to the CUDA Toolkit folder, typically located at:

```
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8
```


## 9. Python TensorRT Installation üé°
Once all the files are copied, run the following command to install TensorRT for Python:

```
pip install "C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\python\tensorrt-8.6.1-cp311-none-win_amd64.whl"
```

üö® **Note:** If this step doesn‚Äôt work, double-check that the `.whl` file matches your Python version (e.g., `cp311` is for Python 3.11). Just locate the correct `.whl` file in the `python` folder and replace the path accordingly.

## 10. Set Your Environment Variables üåé
Add the following paths to your environment variables:
- system varaibles 
- edit `PATH`
- add `NEW`
- click okay 

```
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\lib
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\libnvvp
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin
```

# Setting Up CUDA 11.8 with cuDNN on Windows

Once you have CUDA 11.8 installed and cuDNN properly configured, you need to set up your environment via `cmd.exe` to ensure that the system uses the correct version of CUDA (especially if multiple CUDA versions are installed).

## Steps to Set Up CUDA 11.8 Using `cmd.exe`

### 1. Set the CUDA Path in `cmd.exe`

You need to add the CUDA 11.8 binaries to the environment variables in the current `cmd.exe` session.

Open `cmd.exe` and run the following commands:

```
set PATH=C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin;%PATH%
set PATH=C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\libnvvp;%PATH%
set PATH=C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\extras\CUPTI\lib64;%PATH%
```
These commands add the CUDA 11.8 binary, lib, and CUPTI paths to your system's current session. Adjust the paths as necessary depending on your installation directory.

2. Verify the CUDA Version
After setting the paths, you can verify that your system is using CUDA 11.8 by running:
```
nvcc --version
```
This should display the details of CUDA 11.8. If it shows a different version, check the paths and ensure the proper version is set.

3. **Set the Environment Variables for a Persistent Session**
If you want to ensure CUDA 11.8 is used every time you open `cmd.exe`, you can add these paths to your system environment variables permanently:

1. Open `Control Panel` -> `System` -> `Advanced System Settings`.
Click on `Environment Variables`.
Under `System variables`, select `Path` and click `Edit`.
Add the following entries at the top of the list:
```
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\libnvvp
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\extras\CUPTI\lib64
```
This ensures that CUDA 11.8 is prioritized when running CUDA applications, even on systems with multiple CUDA versions.

4. **Set CUDA Environment Variables for cuDNN**
If you're using cuDNN, ensure the `cudnn64_8.dll` is also in your system path:
```
set PATH=C:\tools\cuda\bin;%PATH%
```
This should properly set up CUDA 11.8 to be used for your projects via `cmd.exe`.
